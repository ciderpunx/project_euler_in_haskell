-- haskell.org solution, note use of let in the comprehension and the z<-[y..999]

-- a helper function to tell us when we have a palindrome (again note the more elegant
-- implementation from haskell.org. This function could have been written:
-- isPalindrome xs = xs == reverse xs
isPalindrome xs 
  | xs == reverse xs    = True
  | otherwise           = False
